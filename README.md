## Description

This project is a gallery of images stored in a file in the project. For each image, there is a button which you can press. How many times the button has been pressed since the server was last started is displayed below the button. When the image itself is click, a description of the image replaces the image. When that description is clicked, the image is brought back.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
